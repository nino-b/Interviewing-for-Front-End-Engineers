# Interviewing for Front-End Engineers

Introduction
Welcome! This repository shows my journey through ["Jem Young's"](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/jem-young/) ["Interviewing for Front-End Engineers"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/interviewing-frontend/) workshop.


## About the Workshop

In this course, we learn to pass front-end engineering interviews, and give better interviews as a technical manager. He walks us through the entire process of the interview from the phone screen to real cultural and technical interview questions that companies use today.

## Structure

This repo consists of my notes from each section of the workshop. Sections covers each section of the interview process:
'/application.md/'.
'/initial-call.md/'.
'/phone-screen.md/'.
'/code-test.md/'.
'/on-site.md/'.
